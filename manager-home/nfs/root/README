well it seems like you are trying to find out what these folders are for.
o.k. here you go:

folder: custom
this is a magic folder that is processed by "initscripts-tcos/rcS.d/setupcustompackages" right after init.
to make it short, read the code:

#!/bin/bash
TMPDIR=/opt/`basename $0`
PACKAGEPATH=/var/tcos/custom

[ -d "$PACKAGEPATH" ] || exit 0

PACKAGES=$(find ${PACKAGEPATH} -maxdepth 1 -type f | sort)

[ "$PACKAGES" ] || exit 0

mkdir -p $TMPDIR
for package in $PACKAGES ; do
        FILETYPE=$(file -bz ${package})
        case ${FILETYPE} in
                Squashfs*)
                        BASENAME=$(basename ${package} .sfs)
                        mkdir -p /opt/${BASENAME}
                        mount -ro loop -t squashfs ${package} /opt/${BASENAME}
                        ;;
                *"filesystem data"*)
                        BASENAME=$(basename ${package})
                        BASENAME=${BASENAME%.*}
                        mkdir -p /opt/${BASENAME}
                        mount -o loop ${package} /opt/${BASENAME}
                        ;;
                "POSIX tar archive (gzip"*)
                        (cd / ; tar -xzf ${package})
                        ;;
                "POSIX tar archive (bzip2"*)
                        (cd / ; tar -xjf ${package})
                        ;;
                "POSIX tar archive")
                        (cd / ; tar -xf ${package})
                        ;;
                *"script text executable"*)
                        BASENAME=$(basename ${package})
                        cp -a ${package} ${TMPDIR}/${BASENAME}
                        chmod +x ${TMPDIR}/${BASENAME}
                        ${TMPDIR}/${BASENAME}
                        rm ${TMPDIR}/${BASENAME}
                        ;;
        esac
done
rmdir $TMPDIR

folder: deploy
this folder contains all JBoss archives to get openthinclient going.
don't mess with this one unless you are a developer and know what you are doing.

folder: etc
this folder contains the following files:
"package_manager.properties" ->  configure your proxy-settigs for the package-manager
"sources.list" -> configure your (apt) sources list as you are used to on a debian system

folder: ldif
developers only

folder schema:
developers only

folder sfs:
developers only

folder tftp:
developers only

folder userprofile:
this might be interesting again:
everything you put inside this folder will be copied to the user-home after the user logged in.
so if you e.g. do have a special firefox configuration for all of your users just drop the ".mozilla" folder here.

folder userprofile-$USERNAME:
this is basically the same as the userprofile-folder but you can drop configurations on a per user basis.
lets say you do have a user "bert" configured: his folder would be "userprofile-bert".

folder var:
here you will find all logs and cached files.
