/**
 * This option is used by DHCP clients to optionally identify the vendor type
 * and configuration of a DHCP client. The information is a string of n octets,
 * interpreted by servers. Vendors may choose to define specific vendor class
 * identifiers to convey particular configuration or other identification
 * information about a client. For example, the identifier may encode the
 * client's hardware configuration. Servers not equipped to interpret the
 * class-specific information sent by a client MUST ignore it (although it may
 * be reported). Servers that respond SHOULD only use option 43 to return the
 * vendor-specific information to the client. The code for this option is 60,
 * and its minimum length is 1.
