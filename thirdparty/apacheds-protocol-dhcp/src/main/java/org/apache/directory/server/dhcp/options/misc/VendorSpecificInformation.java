/**
 * This option is used by clients and servers to exchange vendor- specific
 * information. The information is an opaque object of n octets, presumably
 * interpreted by vendor-specific code on the clients and servers. The
 * definition of this information is vendor specific. The vendor is indicated in
 * the vendor class identifier option. Servers not equipped to interpret the
 * vendor-specific information sent by a client MUST ignore it (although it may
 * be reported). Clients which do not receive desired vendor-specific
 * information SHOULD make an attempt to operate without it, although they may
 * do so (and announce they are doing so) in a degraded mode. If a vendor
 * potentially encodes more than one item of information in this option, then
 * the vendor SHOULD encode the option using "Encapsulated vendor-specific
 * options" as described below: The Encapsulated vendor-specific options field
 * SHOULD be encoded as a sequence of code/length/value fields of identical
 * syntax to the DHCP options field with the following exceptions: 1) There
 * SHOULD NOT be a "magic cookie" field in the encapsulated vendor-specific
 * extensions field. 2) Codes other than 0 or 255 MAY be redefined by the vendor
 * within the encapsulated vendor-specific extensions field, but SHOULD conform
 * to the tag-length-value syntax defined in section 2. 3) Code 255 (END), if
 * present, signifies the end of the encapsulated vendor extensions, not the end
 * of the vendor extensions field. If no code 255 is present, then the end of
 * the enclosing vendor-specific information field is taken as the end of the
 * encapsulated vendor-specific extensions field. The code for this option is 43
 * and its minimum length is 1.
